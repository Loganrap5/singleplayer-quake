# Areas

There are around 5 main areas on the map, those being the entryway, the grand hallway, the courtyard, the throne room, and the library. 

### Entrance
When you make it past the main moat, you find the entrance. With a gate thats been weathered over many years, and many different battles. You can see the effects of war, with loose bricks, and debris everywhere. 

### Grand Hallway
An area that is able to host very large receptions, has been slowly battled over the years. The caretakers had to maintain many different torches that lit up the tall room, as well as the chandelier which is almost destroyed. The player should look out for enemys perched up high, and a few different secrets inside. 

### Courtyard
An almost more beatiful and seemingly untouched area of the fortress, with some loose bricks that act as platforms for more secrets. It seems this area has been maintained by a groundskeeper of some sort, unlikely for the monsters perhaps they have someone doing it for them? 

### Library
One of the more pristine librarys in the kingdom, this place has been used to store intelligence for the many wars that have been fought. This place is one of the reasons this area is so important, and even the monsters know that these are important and it seems like one of the more unbroken parts of the fortress. 

### The throne Room
Being locked by a key, is the most important part of the castle. With quick escape routes and a difficult entryway whoever holds the fortress can hold out here for a while. Its the players job to take this room to solidify the victory. 

# Gameplay

### Entrance 
The player will have to defeat many enemies to get through to the castle. With the monsters trying to prevent people from entering they have their people perched high and low to defend the entrance from siege. 

### Grand Hallway
With the outer defenses being more manned, the player may only find a few patrolling enemies here. You should keep your chin up though, not every enemy is guarding on your level and there are higher areas to look out for. 

### Courtyard
Only a few enemies are patrolling here, with it being in the center of the fortress its strategically less important for them to be guarding, but that doesn't mean you should drop your guard.

### Library
Although everyone knows its importance, the player may not find many monsters here. They seem to not fully comprehend its importance. 

### Throne Room
A few foot soldiers guard the entrance, but you wont get in without a key. Inside you may find the toughest enemy you have faced yet...
