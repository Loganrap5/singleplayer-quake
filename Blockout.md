# Blockout

Below is a video where I show off the general first pass on my blockout for this level. I started off building the main entrance to kind of get an idea for the verticality of how I wanted the level to be. I did not want it to be 
completly flat, so I tried to make a few areas that change that. I continued on with the grand hallway, and I wanted to add life to this place with different details like the balconys, carpets, and the arches. The courtyard was the next step 
and I made it lower then the rest, and added a balcony overlooking it. I tried to use arches for the windows to add some nice details as well. The throne room is going to change a bit, I want to add more encounters as well for the player to navigate through.
