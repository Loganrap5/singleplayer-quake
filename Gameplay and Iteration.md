# Gameplay and Iteration

It was clear that I needed to add more enemies and encounters from my first few playtests. I added more variety with the enemies, 
and after doing mulitple tests I balanced out ammo and health as best I could. I also added two doors that needed to be unlocked with keys
to promote exploration. I noticed the player made it to the final room too quickly, so I added one more area outside of the original plan
to add more depth to the level. This area is right before the throne room outside of the wall to the courtyard. There are a few enemies, some
health pickups and more ammo.
