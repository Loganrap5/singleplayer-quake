### Lighting

After working on texturing the map, I moved over to adding lights. I had difficulties with some areas being too dim, and some too bright. Some areas like 
grand hallway I wanted clear shadows, as there are lots of areas where getting light around every corner would not be possible. In the main courtyard, I wanted it 
to be as visible as possible.
