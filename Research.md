# Research


For this map I took inspiration from many different things. Some are from places I have visited, others I have found in games.


#### Castillo de san Marcos
The inital idea came to me when I visited a fort in St Augustine Florida
It's called Castillo de san Marcos, and is known for its unique star shape. While not medieval, the fortress inspired me to implement something like this in a level.

#### Sen's Fortress

A series I love playing is Dark Souls. Particularly the level design and theme. The outside of my fortress would look somewhat like this.

## A more detailed breakdown

Ive incorporated some of the structural details similar to these. For the fortress to make sense, it needs high walls, a moat, and structural defense. 
I also liked the unique design of the fort, and while its not completly the same as mine, I wanted to incorporate these shapes somehow.
