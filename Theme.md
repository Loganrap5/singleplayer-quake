# Theme

## Medieval Fortress

The overall theme for this map is a Medieval Fortress. The idea came to me when looking for different WAD's to use for level design and I found many similarities between them which helped me come up with this.


### Where is this place in the world?

The fortress is set to be in a key location for a kingdom at war, currently inhabited by monsters. Similar to Harrenhal from Game of Thrones, the location it's in
has had the occupants change many times over the years. 

### What happened here recently? 

The location is held between a chokepoint between the two capitals at war, with this location secured you are able to get a clear military advantage.
It has just been taken over by the monsters who have been at war with the Kindgom for many years.

### What should you be on the lookout for?

With the kingdoms attempted sieges failed, its your task to infilitrate the fortress, take out any enemies, and secure the throne room. 
There are many secret areas to navigate through, that can reveal special weapons hidden from the kingdoms forces to help. 

### What is its architectural style?

Like many fortresses there are thick stone walls, rounded arches, guard towers and lots of enemies. Ill add the star shaped bastions, which helps against enemy fire.

### What is about to happen?

Unbewknownst to the player, you are an intergral part of this war against the monsters. Sneaking in and taking over the fortress in the kingdoms favor will
benefit you more than you know...


## WAD's theme and inspiration

There are many different cobblestone and smooth stone textures that you can find online. This idea came from a trip I made a while back to St Augustine Florida, and there you can find many old monuments.
One particular one I saw was the Castillo de San Marcos monument, which has a very unique design and one of the oldest you can find. Its sort of shaped like a ninja star. While its not medieval, it still gave me the idea to make some sort of fortress the player has 
to get through.

There are many cool WAD's online as well that gave me ideas for different tile designs for floors.

I also had the idea to make some sort of library.
